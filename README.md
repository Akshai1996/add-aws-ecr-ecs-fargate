The components include:
- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: A logically isolated virtual network where your resources are deployed.
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Gateways that enable secure and private connections between your VPC and AWS services.
- **ECS Cluster**: A group of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks that run your containerized applications.
- **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: A fully-managed Docker container registry for storing and retrieving Docker images.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: A load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across your ECS tasks.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Key**: A secure and managed key for encrypting sensitive data.
- **CloudWatch Log groups**: A monitoring service that collects and stores logs from your containerized applications.
- **AWS Secrets Manager Secret**: A cloud native solution to securely manage credentials. This resource was added into the repository as part of use case #5.

The [Terraform configurations](./infra/) and [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/terraform.yml) automate the provisioning and configuration of these components, ensuring a consistent and repeatable deployment process. Here is a detailed note explaining the same - [create-infrastructure-to-host-an-amazon-ecs-service-using-terraform.](http://skundunotes.com/2024/04/10/create-infrastructure-to-host-an-amazon-ecs-service-using-terraform/)

2. Creating the ECS execution role and the ECS task role
3. Creating the ECS task definition
4. Creating an ECS Service
5. Configuring Load Balancing
6. Deploying the Docker image to the ECS Service (using the image pushed in Use Case 2)

The [Terraform configurations](./deploy/) and [GitHub Actions workflows](./.github/workflows/app-ci-cd.yml) handle the deployment and management of the ECS services, ensuring a streamlined and automated process. Here is a detailed note explaining the same - [continuous-deployment-of-amazon-ecs-service-using-terraform-and-github-actions.](http://skundunotes.com/2024/05/06/continuous-deployment-of-amazon-ecs-service-using-terraform-and-github-actions/)

## Use Case 4: Enable Health Checks and CloudWatch Logs for AWS Fargate Tasks
**ðŸ”” Attention:** The code for this specific use case is located in the [`create-ecs-service`](https://github.com/kunduso/add-aws-ecr-ecs-fargate/tree/create-ecs-service) branch. Please refer to this branch instead of the default `main` branch. **ðŸ””**

</br> In AWS Fargate, ensuring the health and monitoring of your tasks is crucial for maintaining reliability and performance. By enabling health checks, you can automatically verify the status of your Fargate tasks, allowing AWS to replace any instances that fail these checks, thereby ensuring seamless operation. Additionally, integrating CloudWatch Logs provides real-time monitoring and centralized logging, capturing logs from each Fargate task and enabling detailed analysis, troubleshooting, and auditing. Together, these features empower you to maintain high availability and streamline operational management within your AWS Fargate environment. This use case has two steps:

1. Add HealthCheck to the AWS Fargate task
2. Monitor logs with Amazon CloudWatch

</br> Here is a detailed note on how to enable that in AWS Fargate -[enabling-health-checks-and-cloudwatch-logs-for-aws-fargate-tasks.](https://skundunotes.com/2024/06/27/enabling-health-checks-and-cloudwatch-logs-for-aws-fargate-tasks/)

## Use Case 5: Protecting Credentials and Variables in AWS Fargate Containers using AWS Secrets Manager
**ðŸ”” Attention:** The code for this specific use case is located in the [`create-ecs-service`](https://github.com/kunduso/add-aws-ecr-ecs-fargate/tree/create-ecs-service) branch. Please refer to this branch instead of the default `main` branch. **ðŸ””**
![Image](https://skdevops.files.wordpress.com/2024/06/96-image-0.png)
This use case focuses on how to store sensitive variables in the AWS Secrets Manager secret and securely access them from an AWS Fargate task container. This use case has five steps:

1. Store a sensitive variable as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Create a VPC Endpoint to access AWS Secrets Manager
3. Update the IAM policy attached to the task role to access the secret
4. Update the Amazon ECS task definition to access the secret
5. Update the Node.js application to access and display the secret

Additionally, this repository includes:
</br> - [Checkov pipeline](./.github/workflows/code-scan.yml) for scanning the Terraform code for security and compliance issues.

The entire setup and deployment process is automated via the GitHub Actions pipelines, eliminating the need for manual steps.

## Prerequisites
For this code to function without errors, create an OpenID connect identity provider in Amazon Identity and Access Management that has a trust relationship with your GitHub repository. You can read about it [here](https://skundunotes.com/2023/02/28/securely-integrate-aws-credentials-with-github-actions-using-openid-connect/) to get a detailed explanation with steps.
<br />Store the `ARN` of the `IAM Role` as a GitHub secret which is referred in the `terraform.yml` and `app-cd-cd.yml` file.
<br />For the **Infracost** integration, create an `INFRACOST_API_KEY` and store that as a GitHub Actions secret. You can manage the cost estimate process using a GitHub Actions variable `INFRACOST_SCAN_TYPE` where the value is either `hcl_code` or `tf_plan`, depending on the type of scan desired.
<br />You can read about that at - [integrate-Infracost-with-GitHub-Actions.](http://skundunotes.com/2023/07/17/estimate-aws-cloud-resource-cost-with-infracost-terraform-and-github-actions/)
## Usage
Ensure that the policy/ies attached to the IAM role whose credentials are being used in this repository has permission to create and manage all the resources that are included in this repository and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR repository.
